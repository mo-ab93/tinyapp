## How To Use TinyApp

### Register/Login
Users must be logged in to create new links, view them, and edit them.

Just click Register on right top, put in your email and password, and you're good to go.

### Create New Links
Either click Create a New Short Link in My URLs page, or Create New URL on navigation bar.

Then simply enter the long URL you want to shorten.

### Edit or Delete Short Links
In My URLs, you can delete any link you want.

You can also click Edit, and then enter a new long URL to update your link. It will be the same short URL, but redirect to an updated long URL.

### Use Your Short Link
The path to use any short link is /u/:shortLink. This will redirect you to the long URL.

You can also reach this by clicking edit on a link, and using the link corresponding to the short URL.
